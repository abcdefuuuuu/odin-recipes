        This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. 
        <br>
        Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.
        <br>
        <h3>So what do I need to make crispy fried chickens</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Chicken</b>: Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store.</li>
            <li><b>Buttermilk</b>: Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken.</li>
            <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.</li>
            <li><b>Seasonings</b>: This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and seasonings to taste.</li>
            <li><b>Oil</b>: Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Are you ready to cook?</h3>
        <br>
        Don't get intimidated by the amount of the ingredients. After all it's just a fried chicken.
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the breading:</b> 
                <br>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.</li>
            <li><b>Dredge the chicken:</b> 
                <br>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk. 
            <br>Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat.
            <br>Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover.</li>
            <li><b>Now you fry the chickens!:</b>
            <br>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. 
            <br>Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes.
            <br>Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy</li>
        </ol>
